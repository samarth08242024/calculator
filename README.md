# calculator
My name is Samarth and this description answers a few questions about the newly made calculator python project

1-	What is this project all about? This project is all about making a code which can solve multiplication, division, subtraction and addition questions using python and visual studio code, this is convenient because you will not always be able to carry a physical calculator around and this is a easy fix.

2-	What python concepts did you learn? Some python concepts that I learnt are, using a forever loop which can be used by writing the following:
“while n==n” if both the n values are the same then the code will keep running until you break the loop, this can  be done by writing:
“v==n: break” you can assign a value for n and if you type that number then the loop will stop. Another concept I learnt was, defining the order of operations. Lastly I also learned using the code “return.” Another thing I learned was changing the numbers to an integer to avoid making it a string. Lastly I learnt how to use multiple is and else conditions.

3-	What algorithrm/logic did you implement? Some of the algorithms I implemented are, adding subtracting, multiplying and dividing and I used python on this project

4- What challenges you faced? One challenge I faced is, figuring out the code for this project as this was my first time doing something like this and I had no experience with this type of code. Another is when I was running the code I got an error with the string and we had to define the variable to fix this problem.
